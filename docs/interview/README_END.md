# Interview
::: tip
Your resume is the answer sheet to your work, and your project experience is the exam outline you give to the interviewer. Therefore, my interview will definitely be related to my resume and work experience. Some interview questions may not apply to everyone, but you can understand what they're examining and what they focus on. You can fill in gaps in basic knowledge.

This is not very suitable for frontend beginners, because when I interview, I assume you already have some frontend basics. I won't ask you the most basic questions like what HTML tags are or the difference between `==` and `===`.

To become a good frontend engineer, strong programming skills alone are far from enough. There's a lot of soft knowledge you need to know:

1. Learn to communicate with people.
2. Frontend is a job that connects different aspects. In actual business, besides dealing with code, you also need to interface with UI, product, backend, and other frontend developers. Sometimes you'll also deal with operations and ad sales. Therefore, how to communicate well with other roles is also a very important ability. No matter how well the code is written, it's useless if it doesn't meet the requirements.
3. Clarify requirements before starting work.
4. Solve problems as soon as they're discovered.
5. Don't refuse communication when there are differences of opinion.
6. Learn to think from others' perspectives, don't always assume things from your own point of view.
